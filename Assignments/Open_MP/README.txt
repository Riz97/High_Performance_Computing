The goal of this homework is to parallelise/vectorise the following program corresponding to an 
implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm.

The focus is on writing an exhaustive report about the code analysis (i.e. hotspot identification) 
and on the iterative process to speedup the application. You should discuss at least the following points:

1.hotspot identification
2.possible vectorization issues
3.scalability using 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 threads.
